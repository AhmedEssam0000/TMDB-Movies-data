# limitations
1- We have used TMBD Movies dataset for our analysis and worked with popularity, revenue and runtime. Our analysis is limited to only the provided dataset. For example, the dataset does not confirm that every release of every director is listed.
2- There is no normalization or exchange rate or currency conversion is considered during this analysis and our analysis is limited to the numerical values of revenue.
3- Dropping missing or Null values from variables of our interest might skew our analysis and could show unintentional bias towards the relationship being analyzed. etc.
